## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) (install globally)

** Move all these files into a folder called sample and install npm package in it **

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

## Install Dependencies


```bash
# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server
npm install
```

## Start the Server

Ensure you are in the `server` directory before starting the server.

```bash
cd server
nodemon app.js
```

This will launch the Node.js server using nodemon, which automatically restarts on file changes.

## Start the React App

Open a new terminal window/tab, navigate to the `client` directory, and start the React app.

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

Your React app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the Node.js server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
